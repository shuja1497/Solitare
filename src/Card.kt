// in kotlin we can only declare property .
// anytime we declare a variable in kotlin its a property
// val >> immutable
// var >> mutable
// constructor is made just after the class name

//    val value: Int = value
//    val suit: String = suit
//    var faceUp: Boolean = faceUp// each card should start face down
//}

// Type 2>>>
// if we add val and var then they will act as a property
